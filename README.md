# 🚀 Day 1 of 30 Projects Challenge

This is **Day 1** of my **30 Projects in 30 Days Challenge** that I’m doing with my coding partner **Swara**.  
The goal of this challenge is to **improve our skills, stay consistent, and learn by building real projects** every single day.

## 📌 Project: Responsive Navbar & Hero Section

For Day 1, I built a **basic responsive landing page** with:  
- A responsive **navigation bar**  
- A clean **hero section with background image**  
- Smooth scrolling between sections  
- A starting point for future projects (like blogs, portfolios, or landing pages)  

Even though it’s a **simple project**, the experience of starting matters more than the complexity.

## 🎯 Learnings from Day 1
- How to set up a simple responsive layout using HTML & CSS  
- Adding smooth scrolling for better user experience  
- The importance of **starting small and building momentum**

👩‍💻 Team Challenge

This project is part of a collaborative 30-day challenge with my coding partner Swara.
We’ll be building one project per day to sharpen our coding skills together.

📅 Next Steps

Stay tuned for Day 2 where we’ll take on a new challenge 🚀
